# OSINT Course Overview

## Introduction
As someone whose exposure to OSINT was limited to what I learned while studying for the Security+ certification, I found this course immensely valuable. The instructor effectively emphasized the importance of retaining the thought process and methodology behind various OSINT techniques, steering clear of an overreliance on any single tool or website. The course offers a wealth of resources, both paid and unpaid, which the instructor regularly uses. The breadth of content covered provided me with a comprehensive understanding of OSINT and introduced me to many tools I was previously unaware of.

## Learning Materials and Methodology
The course was hands-on, featuring practical demonstrations of each resource. For example, using breached Tesla credentials as a case study, and performing OSINT on the instructor himself, providing real-life context. Although the course included case studies and a small challenge, the highlight was its application-oriented approach.

## My Learning Experience
Seeing the instructor demonstrate each tool and articulate his investigative thought process was enlightening. A standout moment was the exploration of website OSINT tools, like subfinder, Assetfinder, httprobe, OWASP Amass, and GoWitness â€“ the last two being familiar to our team. The automation demo of these tools, especially GoWitness, was particularly engaging.

## Conclusion
I believe this course is beneficial for anyone looking to gain a solid foundation in OSINT. It isn't solely taught from a Pentesting perspective but also an investigator's perspective. Its comprehensive approach, hands-on demonstrations, and the instructor's in-depth knowledge make it a worthwhile investment, especially for those new to this field.
